# Chapter 3: Humanoid Robot Hardware

## 3.1 Body and Actuators

Humanoid robots are built to look and move like people. They have a frame, like our skeleton, made from strong, light materials such as aluminum or carbon fiber. This frame gives the robot its shape and holds all its parts. The robot's body is split into parts like a torso, head, arms, and legs. An outer shell, like skin, protects the inside and sometimes has sensors to feel things. This careful design helps the robot balance and move safely.

To move, humanoid robots use special parts called actuators and joints. Joints are like our elbows, knees, and shoulders, allowing the robot to bend and turn. Actuators are mostly electric motors, called servomotors, which are very precise. These servomotors receive commands from the robot's computer brain. Each one moves to a specific position, and together, many motors create smooth, human-like movements. For example, when a robot walks, many servomotors work together in its legs and body to keep it balanced and moving forward.

## 3.2 Sensors

Robots use sensors to gather information about the world, much like humans use their senses. These sensors are like the robot's eyes, ears, and touch. They help robots understand what's around them so they can move safely and do their jobs well.

*   **Touch Sensors**: These sensors help robots feel things. They can be simple buttons or more complex pads that measure pressure. A robot arm uses touch sensors to know how much force to use when picking up an object, so it doesn't crush it. They also help robots avoid bumping into things.
*   **Vision Sensors**: These are usually cameras. They let robots "see" their environment, recognize objects, and track movement. A self-driving car uses vision sensors to spot other cars, people, and traffic signs. In a factory, vision sensors help robots sort parts or check for mistakes.
*   **Audio Sensors**: These are microphones that let robots "hear." They can detect sounds like human voices, which helps voice-controlled robots understand commands. In some cases, they can even tell where a sound is coming from, which is useful for security robots listening for alarms.

By combining information from all these different sensors, robots build a full picture of their surroundings. This allows them to make smart decisions and interact with our world effectively.

## 3.3 Power Systems

Robots need power to move, think, and do their jobs, much like our electronic devices. Most robots get their energy from batteries. These batteries store electrical power and release it when the robot needs it. Lithium-ion batteries are common because they can hold a lot of power without being too heavy.

The kind of battery a robot uses depends on its size and what it does. A small robot might use simple batteries, while a big robot might need many powerful ones to work for hours. Batteries are important because they let robots move freely without being plugged into a wall all the time.

When a robot's batteries run low, they need to be recharged. The simplest way is to plug the robot into an outlet, just like charging a phone. Many robots that work on their own can find special charging stations. They guide themselves to these stations and plug in automatically. There are also newer ways to charge, like wireless charging, where the robot just sits on a pad to get power. This makes charging easy and smooth, allowing robots to keep working with little help from humans.

## 3.4 Materials and Manufacturing

Building robots requires choosing the right materials and using specific manufacturing methods. The materials used depend on what the robot needs to do and where it will operate.

**Common Materials:**
*   **Metals**: Aluminum is popular because it's strong but light, which is good for moving parts. Steel is used for parts that need extra strength.
*   **Plastics**: Plastics like ABS are tough and used for outer shells. PLA is often used for 3D printing test parts. Special plastics are also used for gears because they reduce rubbing.
*   **Composites**: Materials like carbon fiber are extremely strong and light, perfect for high-performance robots.
*   **Rubber and Silicone**: These flexible materials are used for robot grippers to hold objects, or for seals to protect the robot's inside parts.

**Manufacturing Processes:**
*   **Machining**: This involves cutting away material from a block to make precise metal parts. Computers often control the cutting for accuracy.
*   **3D Printing**: This method builds parts layer by layer, which is great for making complex shapes quickly, especially for testing new designs.
*   **Injection Molding**: For plastic parts, melted plastic is squeezed into a mold to quickly make many identical pieces, like robot casings.
*   **Assembly**: Finally, all the different parts are put together using screws, glue, or by welding metal pieces. This makes sure the robot is strong and ready to work.
