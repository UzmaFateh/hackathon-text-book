# Chapter 6: Ethical and Societal Impact

## 6.1 Safety Concerns

As robots become more common, especially humanoid robots that work alongside people, making sure they are safe is extremely important. Robot safety means preventing accidents, building trust, and ensuring these machines work well without causing harm. It's about how robots interact with their surroundings and with us.

Designing robots with safety in mind starts early. Engineers use strong materials, make sure joints move smoothly, and include emergency stop buttons. Robots are equipped with advanced sensors that can detect obstacles and people. If a robot senses something in its path, it can slow down, change direction, or stop to avoid a collision. The software that controls the robot is also carefully made to ensure it acts predictably and doesn't make unexpected moves. All these features work together to make robots safer to be around.

After building, robots go through lots of testing in controlled environments to check for any problems. There are also strict rules and standards that robots must follow to be considered safe. Regular checks and maintenance are needed to keep all safety features working correctly. By following these steps, we can make sure robots not only do their jobs but also keep everyone safe.

## 6.2 Job Displacement

One big question about humanoid robots is how they will change human jobs. As robots get smarter and more capable, they might start doing tasks that people currently do. This could mean that some jobs, especially those that are repetitive, physically demanding, or dangerous, might be taken over by robots. For example, robots could work in factories assembling products or move items around in warehouses.

This change could mean that some people might lose their current jobs or need to learn new skills. However, it's also expected to create new types of jobs. People will be needed to design, build, program, and fix these complex robots. Jobs that require human creativity, deep thinking, or working closely with other people, like teaching, therapy, or art, are likely to become even more important.

The shift in jobs will require us to think about how society can help people adapt. Education will need to teach skills that robots can't easily do. Governments and businesses might need to create new ways to support workers during these changes. The goal is to make sure that as technology advances, it benefits everyone, leading to new opportunities rather than widespread job loss.
