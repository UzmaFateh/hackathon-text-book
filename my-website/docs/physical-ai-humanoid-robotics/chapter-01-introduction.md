## 1.1 What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence that exists in the real world. Unlike virtual AI, which lives only in computers, physical AI controls actual machines. Think of a robot that can walk, pick up objects, or interact with its surroundings. That robot is using physical AI.

The main difference is that physical AI needs to understand and react to the messy, unpredictable real world. Virtual AI, like a chatbot on your phone, operates within digital rules. It doesn't need to worry about gravity, friction, or unexpected bumps. Physical AI, however, must deal with all these things.

For example, a self-driving car uses physical AI. It senses its environment with cameras and sensors, then decides how to steer, accelerate, and brake in real time. This involves complex calculations to navigate roads, avoid obstacles, and ensure safety. This kind of AI must be very robust and adaptable, as the real world is full of surprises. It's about bringing intelligent behavior into physical forms to perform tasks in our environment.

## 1.2 What are Humanoid Robots?

Humanoid robots are machines built to look and move like people. They have a head, a body, two arms, and two legs. This human-like shape helps them work in places made for humans. They can use tools and move around in spaces just like we do.

These robots are designed for many tasks. Some help at home by doing chores or assisting older people. Others work in factories, doing repetitive or dangerous jobs. They can also explore places that are unsafe for humans, like disaster areas. Scientists use humanoid robots to learn more about how we walk and interact with our world. They also bring excitement to education and entertainment.

Humanoid robots are still improving. Their goal is to become helpful partners in our daily lives, making tasks easier and safer. They show us a future where machines can blend into our society in many helpful ways.

## 1.3 Why Combine Them?

Bringing physical AI and humanoid robots together has many good points and some tough challenges. The main idea is to make robots that can think, learn, and move in the real world just like people.

One big benefit is that these robots can do jobs that are risky or hard for humans. Imagine robots working in dangerous places or helping in homes. They can help older people or those who need assistance with daily tasks. This makes life better and safer for many. Also, these robots can teach us new things or entertain us in fun ways. Their human-like shape makes it easier for us to work with them and feel comfortable around them.

However, making these robots is hard. It's tough to build robots that can move as skillfully as humans. Keeping them powered for a long time is also a big challenge. Another difficulty is making AI that truly understands human feelings and social rules. We also need to think about big questions like how these robots might change jobs or keep our private information safe. Making sure these robots are safe to be around is very important too.

## 1.4 A Brief History

The idea of intelligent machines and robots has a long past. Ancient stories told of automatons, or self-moving statues. In the 1950s, a smart man named Alan Turing thought about how we could tell if a machine was thinking. This was a big step for what we now call Artificial Intelligence, or AI. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first used in 1956. Early AI programs could solve simple problems, but computers weren't powerful enough yet.

Around the same time, robots started to appear. The word "robot" came from a play in 1920. The very first working industrial robot, called Unimate, was put in a factory in 1961. These robots did jobs that were boring or dangerous for people. Over time, robots got better and could do more complex tasks. With new computer chips and sensors, robots could move around and even look like humans. Today, AI and robots are often put together to create smart machines that help us in many ways, from factories to our homes.
