# Chapter 2: Basics of AI for Robotics

## 2.1 Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is about teaching computers to learn from information, much like people learn from experience. Instead of giving a computer exact instructions for every task, we give it lots of data. The computer then finds patterns in this data and learns to make decisions or predictions on its own.

Think of it like showing a child many pictures of cats and dogs. Over time, the child learns what a cat looks like and what a dog looks like. When they see a new picture, they can tell if it's a cat or a dog.

There are two main ways computers learn:

*   **Supervised Learning**: This is like learning with a teacher. The computer gets data that has correct answers. For example, it might see pictures of cats, and each picture is labeled "cat." It learns from these examples to identify new cats.
*   **Unsupervised Learning**: This is like learning without a teacher. The computer gets data with no answers. It then tries to find hidden groups or patterns on its own. For instance, it might group customers based on their buying habits without being told what those groups should be.

This ability to learn helps computers do amazing things, like recognize faces, recommend movies, and even help self-driving cars.

## 2.2 Neural Networks

Neural networks are a type of computer program inspired by the human brain. They are very good at recognizing patterns and learning from examples. Imagine teaching a computer to tell the difference between a picture of a cat and a dog. Instead of telling it all the rules, you show it many examples.

These networks are made of many small parts called "neurons," which are connected to each other in layers. When you give the network information, like a picture, it goes through these layers. Each neuron does a simple calculation and passes its result to the next. The connections between neurons have strengths that change as the network learns.

Neural networks learn by making guesses and then adjusting themselves when they are wrong. If the network guesses "dog" but the picture is a cat, it subtly changes its connections to improve its next guess. This process, called "training," happens with thousands of examples. Over time, the network becomes very accurate at recognizing new things it hasn't seen before.

They are used in many common technologies. For instance, they help your phone recognize faces, power voice assistants, and help self-driving cars see the road.

## 2.3 Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a way for AI to learn through trial and error, much like how people or animals learn from experience. Imagine teaching a robot to walk. You don't tell it every single step. Instead, you give it a "reward" when it takes a good step and a "penalty" when it falls.

The robot tries different movements. If a movement helps it stay balanced, it gets a reward. If it makes the robot fall, it gets a penalty. Over time, the robot learns which actions lead to more rewards and avoids actions that lead to penalties. It figures out the best way to walk on its own.

This learning process helps the AI create a "policy" – a set of rules for how to act in different situations to get the best results. It's a powerful way for AI to learn complex behaviors without being specifically programmed for every single possibility. This type of learning is used in things like training robots to play games, drive cars, or perform complicated tasks in the real world.

## 2.4 Computer Vision

Computer vision is how robots "see" and understand the world around them. Just like our eyes send signals to our brain, robots use cameras and sensors to collect visual information. This information is then processed by special computer programs.

These robot "eyes" can be regular cameras that capture images, or special sensors that measure distance to create 3D maps of a room. Some sensors can even detect heat. By combining all this information, robots get a full picture of their surroundings.

After collecting the data, the robot's computer works to make sense of it. It can find edges of objects, separate colors, and identify what different things are, like a chair or a table. This is called object recognition. It helps the robot know what it's looking at.

This ability to see and understand is very important. It allows robots to move around without bumping into things, pick up objects carefully, and even recognize people. Self-driving cars use computer vision to see traffic lights and other cars. It's how robots interact smartly and safely with our world.
